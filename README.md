# Actuarial Present Value Calculator by Her Phay

This project was ported over from a Google Sheets calculator I implemented previously for Actuarial Present Value (APV) calculations for personal insurance comparison purposes.

This is to both complete the CS50x final project and to practice implementing calculations in code, the web-dev is just a side story with heavy lifting done by CS50x finance pset template (for visual appeal)

As this is my first project using proper VCS, commit history is quite cluttered with tests.



# DISCLAIMER
I have no professional training in the Actuarial Sciences, all calculations are done based on my best knowledge, use at your own risk.
