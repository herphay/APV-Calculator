        <h2>What is a life table?</h2>
        <p>
            A life table shows what a population can expect in terms of deaths at each age group. Actual death 
            rate experienced by a population is summarized and used to calculate the probability of death at each 
            age. From there, we can follow a model population's (usually 100k people born) evolution (in terms of 
            how many survives to what age) from birth to death, assuming that they are experiencing the same age 
            specific mortality rates throughout their life. It also includes other information such as the life 
            expectancies at each age.
        </p>

        <h2>How is the life table prepared?</h2>
        <p>
            In Singapore, the Department of Statistics prepare what is called a complete life table. This just
            means that the life table have a granularity of individual ages (age interval of 1 year) rather than
            an abridged life table where the population are grouped into 5 or 10 year age intervals. However, due 
            to the small population size (~6M), death rate at each specific age for each specific year suffers 
            from significant random fluctuations. To counteract this and show actual underlying causes and long 
            term mortality trends, a 3 year average with interpolation method is used. First, central deaths are 
            group by age 0, 1-4, and each subsequent 5 year age groups (5-9, 10-14 etc.). Then, an average rate is 
            calculated based on 3 years' death rates (For reference year n, avg. rate is calculated based on rates 
            of year n-1, n, n+1 with each year's mid-year population. The latest reference year will always be an 
            estimate based on only n-1 and n). Finally, each age group's average rate is decomposed to individual 
            age's mortality based on linear interpolation then adjusted with WhittakerHenderson method of graduation
            to ensure a smooth progression of mortality.
        </p>

        <p>
            * Please note that the mortality rates between 2020 to 2023 has been significantly affected by the Covid-19
            pandemic, especially those of 2021 and 2022. These years' life table will not be representative if we 
            recover to a pre-pandemic mortality rate.
